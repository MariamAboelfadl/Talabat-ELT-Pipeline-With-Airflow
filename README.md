# Talabat Data Pipeline

This project is designed to showcase **data engineering best practices**, including modular DAG design, task orchestration, and SQL-based transformations.

## üìå About the Project
This repository demonstrates a **modern ELT data pipeline** built for a simulated food delivery platform (**Talabat**).  
The pipeline moves data from **PostgreSQL ‚Üí Google Cloud Storage (GCS) ‚Üí BigQuery**, and then transforms it into **Dimension** and **Fact** tables for analytics ‚Äî all orchestrated by **Apache Airflow**.
